          Search doesn't have to be hard. Haystack lets you write your search
          code once and choose the search engine you want it to run on. With a
          familiar API that should make any Djangonaut feel right at home and
          an architecture that allows you to swap things in and out as you need
          to, it's how search ought to&nbsp;be.

          <h3>Haystack 2.0.0!</h3>

          <p class="meta">
            Posted on 2013/05/12 by Daniel
          </p>

          <p>
            After two (far too long) years, Haystack v2.0.0 has been released!
            You can grab it via ``pip install django-haystack==2.0.0``. For
            those who've been holding off on upgrading, the migration
            documentation is at
            <a href="http://django-haystack.readthedocs.org/en/latest/migration_from_1_to_2.html.">http://django-haystack.readthedocs.org/en/latest/migration_from_1_to_2.html.</a>
          <p>

          <p>
            Haystack v2.0.0 features a huge number of improvements as well as
            some backward-incompatible changes. Some of the highlights are:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Multiple backends (you have a Solr &amp; a Whoosh index, or a master Solr &amp; a slave Solr, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
              An Elasticsearch backend
            </li>
            <li>
              Big query improvements
            </li>
            <li>
              Geospatial search (Solr &amp; Elasticsearch only)
            </li>
            <li>
              The addition of Signal Processors for better control
            </li>
            <li>
              Input types for improved control over queries
            </li>
            <li>
              Rich Content Extraction in Solr
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This update is recommended for most installs. If you're relying on
            Xapian, you may want to experiment with it but be warned that it's
            development stalled early in the v2.0 effort.
          </p>

          <p>
            Enjoy!

          <h3>Haystack 1.2.7</h3>

          <p class="meta">
            Posted on 2012/04/06 by Daniel
          </p>

          <p>
            The final release of the Haystack 1.X series, v1.2.7, has been
            released &amp; pushed to PyPI. This release features a number of
            bugfixes as well as incorporating the addition of the
            <code>.values()/.values_list()</code> methods. This release is
            backward-compatible &amp; recommended for most users.
          </p>

          <p>
            All future work will be focused on the 2.X branch (git master)
            unless security issues are found.

          <h3>Haystack 1.2.4 &amp; 2.0.0-alpha</h3>

          <p class="meta">
            Posted on 2011/06/23 by Daniel
          </p>

          <p>
            Haystack has seen many releases since I last updated the site.
            The 1.1.X series had several releases, Haystack 1.2 was released,
            the 1.2.X series has had several releases &amp; I've started work on
            2.0.0-alpha.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Haystack 1.2.X release was mostly bugfixes but newly included
            n-gram support &amp; Whoosh 1.8.X support. You can find more details
            on the
            <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-haystack/browse_thread/thread/f98dc953fd440b28">mailing list</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Meanwhile, work on 2.0.0-alpha has hit master, including the
            long-awaited addition of multiple index support. Similar to Django's
            multidb support, this will allow you to talk to multiple search
            engines at the same time. Things like master-slave setups, a
            separate engine for autocomplete or split public-facing/admin-only
            search are now trivial. When 2.0 lands, it'll be
            backward-incompatible, as I'm also cleaning up other aspects of the
            API.

          <h3>Sprinting to 1.1-final</h3>

          <p class="meta">
            Posted on 2010/11/16 by Daniel
          </p>

          <p>
            Though this site has sat out of date, there has been a lot of work
            put into Haystack 1.1. As of writing, there are eight issues blocking
            the release. I aim to have those down to zero by the end of the
            week.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once those eight are done, I will be releasing 1.1-final. The RC
            process really didn't do much last time and this release has been
            a long time in coming. This release will feature:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Vastly improved faceting</li>
            <li>Whoosh 1.X support!</li>
            <li>Document &amp; field boost support</li>
            <li>Some admin integration</li>
            <li>As well as several more features and a large number of bug fixes</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Looking forward, the goal for future releases is to have much
            shorter cycle (one release every couple months) and have fewer
            major features land between them. 1.1 tried to be too much and the
            timeline suffered as a result.

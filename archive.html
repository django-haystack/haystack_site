          <p>
            Haystack has seen many releases since I last updated the site.
            The 1.1.X series had several releases, Haystack 1.2 was released,
            the 1.2.X series has had several releases &amp; I've started work on
            2.0.0-alpha.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Haystack 1.2.X release was mostly bugfixes but newly included
            n-gram support &amp; Whoosh 1.8.X support. You can find more details
            on the
            <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-haystack/browse_thread/thread/f98dc953fd440b28">mailing list</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Meanwhile, work on 2.0.0-alpha has hit master, including the
            long-awaited addition of multiple index support. Similar to Django's
            multidb support, this will allow you to talk to multiple search
            engines at the same time. Things like master-slave setups, a
            separate engine for autocomplete or split public-facing/admin-only
            search are now trivial. When 2.0 lands, it'll be
            backward-incompatible, as I'm also cleaning up other aspects of the
            API.

          <h3>Sprinting to 1.1-final</h3>

          <p class="meta">

          </p>

          <p>
            Though this site has sat out of date, there has been a lot of work
            put into Haystack 1.1. As of writing, there are eight issues blocking
            the release. I aim to have those down to zero by the end of the
            week.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once those eight are done, I will be releasing 1.1-final. The RC
            process really didn't do much last time and this release has been
            a long time in coming. This release will feature:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Vastly improved faceting</li>
            <li>Whoosh 1.X support!</li>
            <li>Document &amp; field boost support</li>
            <li>Some admin integration</li>
            <li>As well as several more features and a large number of bug fixes</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Looking forward, the goal for future releases is to have much
            shorter cycle (one release every couple months) and have fewer
            major features land between them. 1.1 tried to be too much and the
            timeline suffered as a result.

            Haystack 1.0 has finally been released! It is available on
            <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-haystack">PyPi</a> and
            <a href="http://github.com/toastdriven/django-haystack/downloads">GitHub</a>
            for downloading. You can also now install it via
            <code>pip install django-haystack</code>. You can read the
            announcement

          <p>
            Haystack has made a lot of progress over the this year and there
            are very few blockers left before 1.0-final status. I am doing a
            series of mini sprints over the course of the next week in an effort
            to clear out all blockers.
          </p>

          <p>
            If things go as planned, there should be no 1.0-final tickets
            remaining in the queue by the weekend. I'll then put together an
            1.0-rc1 release for testing. If no show-stoppers arise, a week
            later, I will release 1.0-final. It's been a long time in coming
            and I'm anxious to put the finishing touches on.

          <h3>Whoosh Support</h3>

          <p>
            Haystack now features a new backend:
            <a href="http://whoosh.ca/">Whoosh</a>! This is excellent news, as
            it's both a great way to get up and running with Haystack (as
            Whoosh is pure Python, easy to install and no extra servers are
            needed) as well as a proof-of-concept that Haystack can work (and
            work well) with other backends.
          </p>

          <p>
            You'll need to patch Whoosh (patch included) in order for
            everything to work correctly. We're contributing the patch back to
            Whoosh proper and hope it (or something like it) will be merged
            in shortly.

            The new Haystack site has been launched. It will serve as the
            primary place to check the documentation as well as screencasts.
            More to come soon, especially in the form of additional
            documentation.
